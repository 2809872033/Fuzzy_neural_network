# FFDN: fused fuzzy deep neural network (PyTorch)

This is a re-implemented PyTorch based version of the FFDN which is originally come from the works of "Deng, Y., Ren, Z., Kong, Y., Bao, F., & Dai, Q. (2017). A Hierarchical Fused Fuzzy Deep Neural Network for Data Classification. IEEE Transactions On Fuzzy Systems, 25(4), 1006-1012. doi: 10.1109/tfuzz.2016.2574915".

You can find the Tensorflow/Keras based version at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/sam-nayak/SynthNet

### Requirements
- PyTorch >= 1.7.0
- TorchVision >= 0.1

### Datasets
For testing the FFDN, we mainly used the MNIST dataset (https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/_modules/torchvision/datasets/mnist.html).

### Miscellaneous

Please send any question you might have about the code and/or the algorithm to <phamtheanhphu@gmail.com>.
